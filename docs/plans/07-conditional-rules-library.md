# RFC 07: Conditional Rules and Vertical Policy Library

**Status:** Draft
**Authors:** HushSpec Core Team
**Date:** 2026-03-15
**HushSpec Version:** 0.1.0 (proposed additions targeting 0.2.0)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

HushSpec v0.1.0 provides a solid foundation for declaring static security rules at the AI agent tool boundary. Its ten rule blocks cover filesystem access, network egress, secret detection, shell commands, tool access, computer use, and input injection. The posture extension adds stateful capability management, and the origins extension enables origin-aware policy projection.

However, real-world deployments expose three critical gaps:

1. **Static rules cannot adapt to runtime context.** A healthcare organization may want to allow broader tool access during business hours but restrict it overnight. A financial institution may need different egress rules in production versus staging. Today, these organizations must maintain separate HushSpec documents and swap them externally -- the spec itself has no notion of conditional evaluation.

2. **No general condition system exists.** The posture extension provides state-machine transitions triggered by discrete events (`user_approval`, `budget_exhausted`, `timeout`), and the origins extension matches on request source metadata. Neither supports general-purpose conditions such as time windows, user attributes, environment variables, or rate limits. Organizations are forced to encode these concerns in the enforcement engine, breaking HushSpec's portability guarantee.

3. **No shared policy library exists.** Every organization deploying HushSpec must author policies from scratch. Compliance-driven verticals (healthcare, finance, government) face the same regulatory requirements but have no way to start from vetted, community-reviewed policy templates. This slows adoption and increases the risk of misconfiguration.

This RFC proposes two complementary additions:

- **A condition system** that allows individual rule blocks to declare when they are active, based on deterministic, auditable predicates evaluated against a well-defined runtime context object.
- **A vertical policy library** containing curated, compliance-mapped HushSpec documents for healthcare (HIPAA), finance (SOC2, PCI-DSS), government (FedRAMP), education (FERPA), DevOps, and general-purpose deployments.

Together, these additions transform HushSpec from a static declaration format into an environment-aware security language with a practical on-ramp for regulated industries.

## 2. Current Conditional Capabilities

### 2.1 Posture Extension

The posture extension (`extensions.posture`) defines a finite state machine for capability management:

- **States** declare which capabilities (`file_access`, `file_write`, `egress`, `shell`, `tool_call`, `patch`) are available and impose per-state budget limits (`file_writes: 50`, `egress_calls: 20`).
- **Transitions** move between states in response to discrete events: `user_approval`, `user_denial`, `critical_violation`, `any_violation`, `timeout`, `budget_exhausted`, and `pattern_match`.

This provides a form of conditional behavior -- the active rule set changes based on the current posture state. For example, a `restricted` state can remove shell access while a `standard` state permits it. Transitions can degrade capabilities automatically when budgets are exhausted or violations occur.

**Strengths:**
- Well-defined state semantics with clear transitions
- Budget-based degradation is a powerful safety mechanism
- The `timeout` trigger with duration strings enables time-bounded elevated access

**Gaps:**
- Posture is purely event-driven; there is no way to condition a transition on external context (time of day, user role, environment)
- States are agent-session-scoped; there is no facility for organization-wide or deployment-wide conditional behavior
- Budgets are numeric counters, not rate limits (no "10 per minute" -- only "10 total")

### 2.2 Origins Extension

The origins extension (`extensions.origins`) provides origin-aware policy projection:

- **Profiles** bind match criteria (provider, tenant, space, visibility, tags, actor role) to policy overrides (tool access, egress, data handling, budgets, bridge policies).
- **Matching** uses specificity-based precedence (exact `space_id` beats broad `visibility` match).
- **Composition** is narrowing: origin allowlists intersect with base allowlists, origin blocklists union with base blocklists. The stricter of base or origin always wins.

This is a form of conditional rules -- the effective policy depends on where a request originates. An agent operating in an external-shared Slack channel gets different rules than one in a private incident-response channel.

**Strengths:**
- Rich match criteria covering common enterprise communication platforms
- Narrowing composition enforces the principle of least privilege
- Cross-origin bridge policies address data flow between contexts

**Gaps:**
- Match criteria are limited to origin metadata; no support for user attributes, deployment environment, or temporal conditions
- No general condition combinators (AND/OR/NOT across arbitrary predicates)
- Cannot express "this rule applies only during business hours" or "this rule applies only for premium-tier users"

### 2.3 Gap Analysis

| Capability | Posture | Origins | Needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time-based activation | `timeout` trigger only (duration after state entry) | None | Time windows with timezone support |
| User attributes | None | `actor_role` field in match criteria | General user context (role, tier, groups, department) |
| Environment awareness | None | None | Environment labels (production, staging, dev) |
| Rate limiting | Budgets (total count per session) | Per-origin budgets | Sliding-window rate limits |
| Compound conditions | None | AND semantics on tags | General AND/OR/NOT combinators |
| Capability-based gating | State capabilities (present/absent) | None | Condition on agent capabilities or model type |

## 3. Conditional Rules Design

### 3.1 Design Principles

The condition system is governed by five principles drawn from HushSpec's core philosophy:

1. **Fail-closed.** If a condition cannot be evaluated (missing context field, unknown condition type, evaluation error), the rule block is treated as if it produces a `deny` decision. Specifically: when a `when` condition fails to evaluate, the rule block behaves as though `enabled: false` were set, except that the engine MUST also emit a diagnostic. Since a deactivated rule block does not contribute decisions, the remaining active rule blocks determine the outcome. If no other rule block covers the action type, the engine's default (which MUST be deny for Level 3 conformance) applies.

2. **Deterministic.** Given the same context object and the same condition, the result is always the same. No randomness, no external I/O during evaluation.

3. **Not Turing-complete.** Conditions are a fixed set of predicate types composed with AND/OR/NOT. There are no loops, no variables, no recursion, no general arithmetic, no string manipulation, and no user-defined functions. This is intentional: policies must be auditable by humans and analyzable by tools. The condition language is equivalent in power to a propositional logic over a finite set of ground predicates -- it can express any boolean combination of fixed checks, but it cannot compute new values.

4. **Portable.** Conditions evaluate against a well-defined context object. The context schema is part of the specification; engines populate it from their runtime environment.

5. **Backward-compatible.** The `when` field is optional. Documents without `when` fields are valid and behave identically to v0.1.0. Engines that do not support conditions MUST reject documents containing `when` fields with a clear error message indicating that conditions require HushSpec 0.2.0 support. This preserves fail-closed semantics. Engines MUST NOT silently ignore `when` fields, because doing so could over-permit (a conditional restriction would be evaluated unconditionally as always-active, or worse, always-inactive).

### 3.2 The `when` Field

Each rule block gains an optional `when` field. When present, the rule block is active only if the condition evaluates to `true`. When absent, the rule block is unconditionally active (preserving v0.1.0 behavior).

```yaml
rules:
  egress:
    enabled: true
    allow: ["api.openai.com"]
    default: block
    when:
      context:
        environment: production
```

The `when` field appears at the same level as `enabled`. Evaluation order:

1. If `enabled` is `false`, the rule block is inert regardless of `when`.
2. If `when` is present and evaluates to `false`, the rule block is inert.
3. Otherwise, the rule block is active and its normal semantics apply.

This means `enabled: false` is an unconditional override (useful for emergency disablement), while `when` provides conditional activation.

### 3.3 Condition Types

#### 3.3.1 Time Window Conditions

Activate a rule block only during specific time periods.

```yaml
rules:
  tool_access:
    allow: [deploy, database_write]
    default: block
    when:
      time_window:
        start: "09:00"
        end: "17:00"
        timezone: "America/New_York"
        days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
```

**Schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `start` | string | REQUIRED | -- | Start time in `HH:MM` (24-hour) format |
| `end` | string | REQUIRED | -- | End time in `HH:MM` (24-hour) format |
| `timezone` | string | OPTIONAL | `"UTC"` | IANA timezone identifier |
| `days` | array of string | OPTIONAL | all days | Day abbreviations: `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun` |

**Semantics:**
- If `start` < `end`, the window is the period from `start` to `end` on the specified days.
- If `start` > `end`, the window wraps across midnight (e.g., `start: "22:00"`, `end: "06:00"` covers 10 PM to 6 AM).
- If `start` == `end`, the window is the entire day (24 hours) on the specified days.
- An invalid timezone identifier MUST cause document rejection (fail-closed).
- The current time is obtained from the engine's runtime environment. Engines MUST document their time source and SHOULD support clock injection for testing.

#### 3.3.2 Context Conditions

Activate a rule block based on runtime context values.

```yaml
rules:
  egress:
    allow: ["*.internal.corp"]
    default: block
    when:
      context:
        environment: production
        user.tier: premium
```

**Schema:**

The `context` condition is an object whose keys are dot-delimited paths into the runtime context object (Section 3.4) and whose values are the expected values. All key-value pairs must match (AND semantics).

| Value Type | Matching Rule |
|---|---|
| string | Exact string equality |
| boolean | Exact boolean equality |
| integer | Exact numeric equality |
| array of string | Context field value must be one of the listed values (OR within a single key) |

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Match exactly one value
when:
  context:
    environment: production

# Match any of several values (OR within a key)
when:
  context:
    environment: [production, staging]

# Match multiple fields (AND across keys)
when:
  context:
    environment: production
    user.role: admin

# Match nested context using dot notation
when:
  context:
    agent.type: coding-assistant
    user.groups: ml-team   # true if "ml-team" is in user.groups array
```

**Missing context fields:** If a context condition references a field that is not present in the runtime context object, the condition evaluates to `false` (fail-closed). The engine SHOULD log a warning indicating which context field was missing.

#### 3.3.3 Capability Conditions

Activate a rule block based on the declared capabilities of the agent.

```yaml
rules:
  secret_patterns:
    enabled: true
    patterns:
      - name: database_connection_string
        pattern: "(?i)(postgres|mysql|mongodb)://[^\\s]+"
        severity: critical
    when:
      capability:
        has: [database_access]
```

**Schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `has` | array of string | OPTIONAL | Capabilities that MUST be present (AND) |
| `lacks` | array of string | OPTIONAL | Capabilities that MUST be absent (AND) |

**Semantics:**
- The agent's declared capabilities are provided in the context object under `agent.capabilities`.
- If `has` is specified, every listed capability must be present in `agent.capabilities`.
- If `lacks` is specified, none of the listed capabilities may be present in `agent.capabilities`.
- If both `has` and `lacks` are specified, both constraints must be satisfied.
- If `agent.capabilities` is not present in the context, the condition evaluates to `false`.

#### 3.3.4 Rate Conditions

Activate (or deactivate) a rule block based on action frequency. Unlike posture budgets (which are total counts per session), rate conditions express sliding-window limits.

```yaml
rules:
  tool_access:
    allow: []
    block: [deploy]
    default: allow
    when:
      rate:
        action_type: tool_call
        count: 100
        window: "1h"
        behavior: activate_above
```

**Schema:**

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `action_type` | string | REQUIRED | -- | Action type to count (from Section 5 of core spec) |
| `count` | integer | REQUIRED | -- | Threshold count |
| `window` | string | REQUIRED | -- | Sliding window duration (same format as posture `after`: `<number><unit>`, unit in `s`, `m`, `h`, `d`) |
| `behavior` | string | OPTIONAL | `"activate_above"` | One of `"activate_above"` or `"activate_below"` |

**Semantics:**
- `activate_above`: The rule block is active when the number of actions of the specified type within the sliding window exceeds `count`. This is the common case -- "after 100 tool calls in an hour, activate this restrictive rule."
- `activate_below`: The rule block is active when the action count is at or below `count`. This is useful for "allow expensive operations only when usage is low."
- The engine is responsible for maintaining action counters. Counter scope (per-session, per-user, per-agent) is engine-specific but MUST be documented.
- If the engine does not support rate tracking, the condition evaluates to `false` (fail-closed), and the engine MUST log a warning.

#### 3.3.5 Compound Conditions

Combine multiple conditions with boolean logic.

```yaml
rules:
  shell_commands:
    forbidden_patterns: []
    when:
      all_of:
        - time_window:
            start: "09:00"
            end: "17:00"
            timezone: "America/New_York"
            days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
        - context:
            environment: production
            user.role: [admin, sre]
```

**Combinators:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `all_of` | array of Condition | All conditions must be true (AND) |
| `any_of` | array of Condition | At least one condition must be true (OR) |
| `not` | Condition | The condition must be false (NOT) |

**Nesting:** Combinators may be nested to any depth. However, implementations MAY impose a maximum nesting depth (RECOMMENDED: 8 levels) to prevent pathological cases. Documents exceeding the depth limit MUST be rejected.

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Business hours AND production AND (admin OR sre)
when:
  all_of:
    - time_window:
        start: "09:00"
        end: "17:00"
        timezone: "UTC"
    - context:
        environment: production
    - any_of:
        - context:
            user.role: admin
        - context:
            user.role: sre

# NOT during maintenance window
when:
  not:
    time_window:
      start: "02:00"
      end: "04:00"
      timezone: "America/Los_Angeles"
      days: [sun]

# Off-hours restriction (activate rule when NOT business hours)
when:
  not:
    time_window:
      start: "09:00"
      end: "17:00"
      timezone: "America/New_York"
      days: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
```

### 3.4 Runtime Context Object

The context object is a structured bag of key-value pairs populated by the engine at evaluation time. Conditions reference context fields using dot-delimited paths.

```yaml
# Canonical context schema (informative)
context:
  user:
    id: "user-123"
    role: "developer"
    tier: "premium"
    groups: ["engineering", "ml-team"]
    department: "engineering"
    email_domain: "corp.example.com"
  environment: "production"
  deployment:
    region: "us-east-1"
    cluster: "prod-01"
    cloud_provider: "aws"
  agent:
    id: "agent-456"
    type: "coding-assistant"
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-6"
    capabilities: ["file_access", "file_write", "egress", "tool_call"]
    version: "2.1.0"
  session:
    id: "session-789"
    started_at: "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    action_count: 42
    duration_seconds: 1800
  request:
    id: "req-012"
    timestamp: "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  custom: {}
```

**Standard context fields:**

| Path | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `user.id` | string | Unique user identifier |
| `user.role` | string | User's role (e.g., `admin`, `developer`, `viewer`) |
| `user.tier` | string | Subscription or access tier |
| `user.groups` | array of string | Groups the user belongs to |
| `user.department` | string | Organizational department |
| `user.email_domain` | string | Domain portion of user's email |
| `environment` | string | Deployment environment (`production`, `staging`, `development`, `test`) |
| `deployment.region` | string | Cloud region or datacenter identifier |
| `deployment.cluster` | string | Cluster or deployment group identifier |
| `deployment.cloud_provider` | string | Cloud provider identifier |
| `agent.id` | string | Unique agent instance identifier |
| `agent.type` | string | Agent type (e.g., `coding-assistant`, `data-analyst`) |
| `agent.model` | string | Model identifier |
| `agent.capabilities` | array of string | Declared agent capabilities |
| `agent.version` | string | Agent version |
| `session.id` | string | Session identifier |
| `session.started_at` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of session start |
| `session.action_count` | integer | Total actions in this session |
| `session.duration_seconds` | integer | Session duration in seconds |
| `request.id` | string | Current request identifier |
| `request.timestamp` | string | ISO 8601 timestamp of current request |
| `custom` | object | Engine-specific custom fields |

**Extensibility:** The `custom` namespace is reserved for engine-specific context fields. Condition expressions MAY reference `custom.*` paths. Standard fields (everything outside `custom`) are part of the specification and engines SHOULD populate them when the information is available.

**Array membership:** When a context condition references a field whose value is an array (e.g., `user.groups`) and the condition value is a scalar string, the condition is true if the scalar is a member of the array. This enables patterns like:

```yaml
when:
  context:
    user.groups: ml-team  # true if "ml-team" is in the user.groups array
```

### 3.5 Condition Evaluation Semantics

#### 3.5.1 Evaluation Order

Conditions are evaluated **before** rule-block-specific logic. This avoids unnecessary work (e.g., regex compilation for secret patterns) when the condition will deactivate the block.

The full evaluation pipeline for a single action against a single rule block:

1. Check `enabled`. If `false`, the block is inert. Stop.
2. Evaluate `when`. If the condition is `false`, the block is inert. Stop.
3. Apply rule-block-specific semantics (pattern matching, allowlist checks, etc.).
4. Produce a decision (`allow`, `warn`, or `deny`).

#### 3.5.2 Interaction with Decision Precedence

Conditional rules do not change decision precedence (Section 6.1 of the core spec). When a condition deactivates a rule block, that block simply does not participate in the decision. It is as if the block were absent from the document.

Example: A document has two `tool_access` configurations (one conditional, one not). This is NOT how HushSpec works -- each rule block appears at most once. Instead, conditional rules within a single block control whether that block contributes to the decision.

If an organization needs different tool-access rules for different contexts, they should use either:
- The `extends` mechanism with separate documents, or
- The origins extension for origin-based variation, or
- Multiple documents with conditions on different rule blocks that collectively cover the policy.

#### 3.5.3 Interaction with Posture and Origins

The `when` field is available on core rule blocks only (within `rules.*`). Extension blocks (`extensions.posture`, `extensions.origins`, `extensions.detection`) do not support `when` in this proposal. The rationale is that posture and origins already provide their own conditional mechanisms; adding `when` to them would create confusing interactions. A future RFC may revisit this constraint.

The condition system is orthogonal to posture and origins:

- **Posture** manages state transitions driven by events within the agent session. Conditions gate static rule blocks based on external context. They can coexist: a rule block might be conditional on business hours (via `when`) while the posture extension manages degradation within those hours (via budget exhaustion). Importantly, posture capability checks are evaluated independently of `when` conditions. If a `when` condition deactivates a rule block, posture still enforces its own capability restrictions. For example, if `rules.tool_access` is deactivated by a `when` condition, but the current posture state lacks the `tool_call` capability, the action is still denied by posture -- posture operates at a layer below rule blocks.

- **Origins** project policy based on request source. Conditions gate rule blocks based on runtime context. They can coexist: an origin profile might restrict tool access for external channels, while a `when` condition further restricts tool access outside business hours. Origin narrowing is applied after `when` evaluation: first the rule block is activated/deactivated by `when`, then origin overrides are composed on top of the active rule block.

There is intentional overlap between `context.user.role` in conditions and `actor_role` in origins match criteria. The guidance is:
- Use **origins** when the policy variation is tied to the communication platform and channel context (Slack channel visibility, GitHub PR context).
- Use **conditions** when the policy variation is tied to deployment environment, time, user attributes, or agent properties that are independent of the communication platform.

#### 3.5.4 Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Unknown condition type | Document rejection (fail-closed) |
| Missing context field referenced by `context` condition | Condition evaluates to `false`; engine SHOULD log warning |
| Invalid timezone in `time_window` | Document rejection (fail-closed) |
| Invalid `start`/`end` time format | Document rejection (fail-closed) |
| Invalid day abbreviation in `days` | Document rejection (fail-closed) |
| `rate` condition when engine lacks rate tracking | Condition evaluates to `false`; engine MUST log warning |
| Nesting depth exceeded | Document rejection (fail-closed) |
| Type mismatch (condition expects string, context has integer) | Condition evaluates to `false`; engine SHOULD log warning |
| Engine does not support conditions but document contains `when` | Document rejection with clear error message |

## 4. Design Considerations

### 4.1 Simplicity and Auditability

The condition system is deliberately limited. There are exactly five condition types (`time_window`, `context`, `capability`, `rate`, and compound combinators). This is not accidental -- every condition type added increases the cognitive burden on policy authors and auditors. A security auditor reviewing a HushSpec document should be able to understand every condition's effect without consulting external documentation or running code.

**Anti-goals:**
- No expression language (no `user.age > 18`)
- No string interpolation or templating
- No reference to external data sources at evaluation time
- No conditional mutation of rule parameters (a condition activates or deactivates a block; it does not change the block's values)

### 4.2 Turing-Completeness Avoidance

The condition system is intentionally not Turing-complete:
- No loops or recursion
- No mutable state (conditions are pure predicates)
- No general arithmetic (rate conditions have a fixed threshold comparison, not arbitrary expressions)
- No string operations (no regex, no substring, no concatenation)
- Finite nesting depth for compound conditions
- No self-reference (a condition cannot reference the result of another condition)
- No data flow between conditions (each condition evaluates independently against the context)

This guarantees that condition evaluation always terminates and has bounded resource consumption. Specifically, evaluation of a condition tree of depth D with N leaf conditions requires O(N) predicate evaluations and O(D) stack depth, both bounded by document validation.

### 4.3 Determinism

Given the same context object and the same wall-clock time, condition evaluation MUST produce the same result. Conditions do not have side effects. The `rate` condition depends on historical action counts, which is state external to the condition itself -- the engine maintains this state and injects it into the evaluation. The condition itself is a pure function of its inputs.

### 4.4 Performance

Conditions are evaluated before rule-block logic, so they serve as early-exit short circuits:
- A `context` condition is a map lookup and comparison -- O(k) where k is the number of context keys in the condition.
- A `time_window` condition is a single timestamp comparison -- O(1).
- A `capability` condition is an array membership check -- O(c * h) where c is the number of agent capabilities and h is the number of `has`/`lacks` entries.
- A `rate` condition requires a counter lookup -- O(1) with appropriate data structures.
- Compound conditions are bounded by the nesting depth limit.

Rule-block logic (regex compilation, glob matching) is avoided entirely when the condition short-circuits.

## 5. Schema Changes

### 5.1 Condition Schema (JSON Schema)

The following additions to the core schema introduce the condition system.

```json
{
  "$defs": {
    "Condition": {
      "oneOf": [
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/TimeWindowCondition" },
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/ContextCondition" },
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/CapabilityCondition" },
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/RateCondition" },
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/AllOfCondition" },
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/AnyOfCondition" },
        { "$ref": "#/$defs/NotCondition" }
      ]
    },
    "TimeWindowCondition": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["time_window"],
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "properties": {

              "type": "string",
              "pattern": "^([01]\\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\\d$",
              "description": "End time in HH:MM 24-hour format."
            },

              "description": "IANA timezone identifier (e.g., America/New_York)."
            },

              },
              "description": "Days of the week. Defaults to all days."
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "ContextCondition": {
      "type": "object",
      "required": ["context"],
      "additionalProperties": false,
      "properties": {

        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Rule Block Schema Changes

Each rule block definition (e.g., `ForbiddenPaths`, `Egress`, `ToolAccess`) gains an optional `when` property:

```json
{
  "when": {
    "$ref": "#/$defs/Condition",
    "description": "Condition that must be true for this rule block to be active."
  }
}
```

This is added to: `ForbiddenPaths`, `PathAllowlist`, `Egress`, `SecretPatterns`, `PatchIntegrity`, `ShellCommands`, `ToolAccess`, `ComputerUse`, `RemoteDesktopChannels`, `InputInjection`.

### 5.3 Backward Compatibility

- `when` is optional on all rule blocks. Documents without `when` are fully backward-compatible.
- Engines that do not implement conditions MUST reject documents containing `when` fields with a clear error message indicating conditions are not supported. This preserves fail-closed semantics and prevents silent misconfiguration.
- The recommended approach for engines that do not implement conditions is rejection, which preserves fail-closed semantics.

### 5.4 Versioning Strategy

The condition system is introduced in HushSpec 0.2.0. Documents using conditions MUST declare `hushspec: "0.2.0"`. This allows engines to detect and reject unsupported features cleanly.

Since HushSpec is in the v0.x series, this is a permitted minor-version change. Engines supporting 0.2.0 MUST also accept 0.1.0 documents (which will never contain `when` fields).

**Conformance test requirement:** The conformance test suite MUST include a test vector where a 0.1.0-only engine receives a 0.2.0 document containing `when` fields. The expected behavior is document rejection with a version-mismatch error.

## 6. Vertical Policy Library

### 6.1 Library Structure

The policy library lives in a top-level `library/` directory alongside `rulesets/`. While `rulesets/` contains generic security profiles (default, strict, permissive), `library/` contains compliance-mapped, vertical-specific policies.

```
library/
  healthcare/
    hipaa-base.yaml               # HIPAA-compliant base policy
    hipaa-coding-agent.yaml       # Coding assistants in healthcare orgs
    hipaa-data-analysis.yaml      # Data analysis agents handling PHI
    README.md
  finance/
    soc2-base.yaml                # SOC2 compliance base
    pci-dss.yaml                  # PCI-DSS for payment data contexts
    trading-agent.yaml            # Quantitative trading agents
    README.md
  government/
    fedramp-base.yaml             # FedRAMP-aligned base
    itar-restricted.yaml          # ITAR-controlled environments
    README.md
  education/
    ferpa-student-agent.yaml      # Student-facing agents (FERPA)
    grading-agent.yaml            # Automated grading systems
    README.md
  devops/
    cicd-hardened.yaml            # Hardened CI/CD pipeline security
    incident-response.yaml        # Incident response agents
    README.md
  general/
    minimal.yaml                  # Minimal viable security
    recommended.yaml              # Recommended production baseline
    maximum.yaml                  # Maximum security posture
    air-gapped.yaml               # No network access, no shell
    README.md
```

Each vertical directory contains:
- One or more `.yaml` HushSpec policy files
- A `README.md` documenting the threat model, compliance mapping, and usage guidance

### 6.2 Policy Authoring Conventions

Every library policy MUST:

1. Include a `name` field matching the filename (without extension).
2. Include a `description` field summarizing the policy's purpose and target vertical.
3. Document each rule block with inline YAML comments mapping rules to specific compliance controls.
4. Use `extends` when appropriate to layer on top of a base policy.
5. Pass `cargo test --workspace` and all conformance test vectors.
6. Include a companion test fixture file in `fixtures/library/<vertical>/` that exercises key scenarios.

### 6.3 HIPAA Policy (Healthcare)

#### 6.3.1 Threat Model

**What we are protecting:** Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined by the HIPAA Privacy Rule (45 CFR 164.514). This includes patient names, medical record numbers, social security numbers, dates of treatment, diagnoses, prescription information, and any data that could identify an individual patient.

**Threat actors:**
- AI agent inadvertently leaking PHI to unauthorized external services via egress
- AI agent writing PHI to log files, temporary files, or unprotected locations
- AI agent executing shell commands that could exfiltrate data
- Prompt injection attacks causing the agent to reveal PHI
- Accidental inclusion of PHI in code patches or commits
- Insiders using AI agents to bypass access controls on patient data

**Compliance controls addressed:**
- 45 CFR 164.312(a)(1) -- Access Control: Technical policies to allow access only to authorized persons
- 45 CFR 164.312(a)(2)(i) -- Unique User Identification: Assign unique identifier for tracking
- 45 CFR 164.312(b) -- Audit Controls: Hardware/software/procedural mechanisms to record and examine access
- 45 CFR 164.312(c)(1) -- Integrity Controls: Protect ePHI from improper alteration or destruction
- 45 CFR 164.312(d) -- Person or Entity Authentication: Verify identity before granting access
- 45 CFR 164.312(e)(1) -- Transmission Security: Guard against unauthorized access during transmission
- 45 CFR 164.502 -- Uses and Disclosures of PHI: General rules for permissible uses
- 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c) -- De-identification Standard: Requirements for removing identifiers
- 45 CFR 164.404-164.410 -- Breach Notification: Requirements for notifying affected parties

### 6.4 SOC2 Policy (Finance/SaaS)

#### 6.4.1 Threat Model

**What we are protecting:** Customer data, internal systems, and audit trails in accordance with the AICPA Trust Services Criteria for SOC2 Type II.

**Threat actors:**
- AI agent writing to production infrastructure without authorization
- AI agent accessing customer databases or PII
- Uncontrolled deployments bypassing change management
- Data exfiltration through unrestricted egress
- Privilege escalation through unrestricted tool access
- AI agent modifying audit logs or compliance artifacts

**SOC2 Trust Services Criteria addressed:**
- CC6.1 -- Logical and Physical Access Controls: Entity implements logical access security software, infrastructure, and architectures over protected information assets
- CC6.2 -- Access to Protected Information Assets: Prior to issuing system credentials and granting system access, the entity registers and authorizes new users
- CC6.3 -- Access to Protected Information -- Restricted: The entity authorizes, modifies, or removes access to data, software, functions, and other protected information assets based on roles
- CC6.6 -- System Operations -- External Threats: The entity implements controls to prevent or detect and act upon the introduction of unauthorized or malicious software
- CC6.7 -- System Operations -- Transmission Security: The entity restricts the transmission, movement, and removal of information to authorized internal and external users and processes
- CC6.8 -- System Operations -- Unauthorized Changes: The entity implements controls to prevent or detect and act upon unauthorized changes
- CC7.1 -- System Operations -- Detection of Changes: To meet its objectives, the entity uses detection and monitoring procedures to identify changes to configurations
- CC7.2 -- System Operations -- Monitoring: The entity monitors system components for anomalies
- CC8.1 -- Change Management: The entity authorizes, designs, develops, configures, documents, tests, approves, and implements changes to infrastructure, data, software, and procedures

### 6.5 PCI-DSS Policy (Finance/Payments)

#### 6.5.1 Threat Model

**What we are protecting:** Cardholder data (CHD) and sensitive authentication data (SAD) as defined by PCI-DSS v4.0. This includes primary account numbers (PANs), cardholder names, expiration dates, service codes, and card verification values (CVV/CVC).

**Threat actors:**
- AI agent processing or storing PAN data in plaintext (violates Req 3.4)
- AI agent logging or writing CVV/CVC values post-authorization (violates Req 3.2)
- AI agent transmitting CHD over unrestricted egress channels (violates Req 4.1)
- AI agent accessing payment processing infrastructure without authorization (violates Req 7.1)
- Prompt injection causing the agent to exfiltrate card data
- AI agent executing database queries that return cardholder data

**PCI-DSS v4.0 Requirements addressed:**
- Req 1.3 -- Network access to and from the cardholder data environment is restricted
- Req 2.2 -- System components are configured and managed securely
- Req 3.2 -- Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited
- Req 3.4 -- PAN is secured wherever it is stored
- Req 3.5 -- PAN is secured wherever it is transmitted
- Req 4.1 -- Strong cryptography is used during transmission of CHD over open, public networks
- Req 6.3 -- Security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed
- Req 7.1 -- Access to system components and CHD is limited to those whose job requires it
- Req 10.2 -- Audit logs record all actions affecting CHD

#### 6.5.2 PCI-DSS Policy

**Threat actors:**
- AI agent accessing CUI or FOUO documents without authorization
- AI agent egressing to non-FedRAMP-authorized cloud services
- AI agent modifying infrastructure-as-code that governs federal systems
- AI agent interacting with cloud provider CLIs in unauthorized ways
- Nation-state adversaries using prompt injection to extract federal data

**NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 control families addressed:**
- AC-3 -- Access Enforcement: The system enforces approved authorizations
- AC-6 -- Least Privilege: The system enforces the most restrictive set of privileges
- AU-2 -- Audit Events: The system is capable of auditing defined events
- CM-3 -- Configuration Change Control: The organization authorizes, documents, and controls changes
- CM-7 -- Least Functionality: The system provides only essential capabilities
- SC-7 -- Boundary Protection: The system monitors and controls communications at external managed interfaces
- SC-8 -- Transmission Confidentiality and Integrity: The system protects information during transmission

### 6.7 FERPA Education Policy

#### 6.7.1 Threat Model

**What we are protecting:** Student education records and personally identifiable information (PII) from education records, as protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99).

**Threat actors:**
- AI agent accessing or disclosing student grades, disciplinary records, or financial aid data
- AI agent transmitting student PII to unauthorized third-party services
- AI agent assisting students in academic dishonesty (accessing grading rubrics or answer keys)
- Prompt injection causing disclosure of other students' records

**FERPA provisions addressed:**
- 34 CFR 99.3 -- Definition of education records (what is protected)
- 34 CFR 99.30 -- Conditions for prior consent (disclosure requires consent)
- 34 CFR 99.31 -- Exceptions to consent requirement (directory information, legitimate educational interest)
- 34 CFR 99.33 -- Limitations on redisclosure
- 34 CFR 99.35 -- Conditions for disclosure to certain federal/state authorities

### 6.8 DevOps Policies

#### 6.8.1 Hardened CI/CD Pipeline Policy

**Threat model:** AI agents operating within CI/CD pipelines have access to build infrastructure, deployment credentials, and artifact registries. The primary threats are: supply-chain attacks via malicious dependencies or build modifications, secret leakage through build logs, unauthorized deployments to production, and lateral movement through infrastructure credentials stored in CI environments.

## 7. Community Contribution Model

### 7.1 Policy Lifecycle

Every policy in the library follows a defined lifecycle:

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| **Draft** | Initial submission. Undergoing review. Not recommended for production. |
| **Review** | Community review period (minimum 30 days). Compliance mapping under audit. |
| **Accepted** | Reviewed and merged. Suitable for production with customization. |
| **Stable** | Has been in production use for 6+ months with no significant issues. |
| **Deprecated** | Superseded by a newer version or no longer maintained. |

### 7.2 Contribution Requirements

Contributors submitting a vertical policy MUST provide:

1. **Policy YAML file(s)** conforming to the HushSpec schema and passing all validation.
2. **README.md** for the vertical directory containing:
   - Threat model (what assets are protected, what threat actors are considered)
   - Compliance mapping table (regulation section to HushSpec rule)
   - Known limitations and false-positive risks
   - Customization guidance (which fields organizations should change)
3. **Test fixtures** in `fixtures/library/<vertical>/` with at minimum:
   - 5 scenarios testing expected `allow` decisions
   - 5 scenarios testing expected `deny` decisions
   - 2 scenarios testing edge cases (pattern near-misses, boundary values)
4. **Changelog entry** in the vertical's README for each modification.

### 7.3 Compliance Certification Disclaimer

The HushSpec project does NOT certify that policies meet regulatory requirements. This is a critical distinction:

- Library policies are **aligned with** compliance frameworks, not **certified for** them.
- Each policy README and each policy YAML file includes a prominent disclaimer: *"This policy is a starting point for compliance. It does not constitute legal or compliance advice. Organizations are responsible for validating that their configuration meets their specific regulatory obligations."*
- Compliance mapping tables cite specific regulation sections and describe how the HushSpec rule addresses the control objective, but this mapping is informational.
- Organizations SHOULD have their customized policies reviewed by qualified compliance personnel:
  - **HIPAA:** A HIPAA Privacy Officer or qualified compliance consultant
  - **PCI-DSS:** A Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) or Internal Security Assessor (ISA)
  - **FedRAMP:** A Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO) and the authorizing official
  - **FERPA:** The institution's FERPA compliance officer or legal counsel
  - **SOC2:** The organization's external auditor (CPA firm)

### 7.4 Review Process

1. **Submission:** Contributor opens a pull request with the policy, README, and test fixtures.
2. **Automated checks:** CI validates the policy against the HushSpec schema, runs test fixtures, and checks that the README contains required sections.
3. **Peer review:** At least two maintainers review for:
   - Schema conformance and validation pass
   - Reasonable threat model
   - Compliance mapping accuracy (spot-check, not exhaustive audit)
   - Test fixture coverage
   - Documentation quality
4. **Community feedback period:** The PR remains open for at least 14 days after initial review approval to allow community feedback.
5. **Merge:** A maintainer merges the PR. The policy enters `Draft` stage.
6. **Promotion to Accepted:** After the 30-day review period with no blocking issues, a maintainer promotes the policy to `Accepted`.

### 7.5 Versioning and Maintenance

- Library policies are versioned via the HushSpec document's `hushspec` field and Git history.
- When the core HushSpec schema changes (e.g., new rule blocks in 0.2.0, 0.3.0), library policies MUST be updated within 90 days or be marked `Deprecated`.
- Breaking changes to a policy (removing patterns, relaxing restrictions) require a new file with a versioned name (e.g., `hipaa-base-v2.yaml`) and deprecation of the old file.
- Non-breaking changes (adding patterns, tightening restrictions) are applied in-place.

### 7.6 Deprecation

Deprecated policies:
- Remain in the repository for 6 months after deprecation.
- Include a deprecation notice in YAML comments and the vertical README.
- Are excluded from CI test suites after removal.
- Are moved to an `archive/` subdirectory after the 6-month grace period, then removed in the next minor release.

## 9. Alternatives Considered

### 9.1 Open Policy Agent (OPA) / Rego

OPA is a general-purpose policy engine using the Rego language. It was considered as the basis for HushSpec's condition system.

**Why not:**
- Rego is a full programming language with imports, comprehensions, and partial evaluation. This violates our non-Turing-complete principle and makes policies difficult to audit without Rego expertise.
- OPA is designed for infrastructure policy (Kubernetes admission, API authorization). Its data model does not align with AI agent tool-boundary concerns.
- Rego policies are not portable YAML -- they require a Rego runtime, adding a dependency to every HushSpec engine.
- HushSpec's fail-closed philosophy requires that invalid or unparseable policies deny everything. OPA's default is more nuanced (undefined decisions, partial results), which creates semantic mismatches.

**What we took from OPA:** The concept of a structured input document (OPA's `input`) informed our runtime context object design. OPA's approach of separating policy from data is reflected in HushSpec's separation of rule declarations from engine implementation.

### 9.2 AWS Cedar

Cedar is Amazon's policy language used in Amazon Verified Permissions. It was considered for its clean syntax and formal verification properties.

**Why not:**
- Cedar is tightly coupled to the AWS entity-attribute model (principals, actions, resources, conditions). HushSpec's domain model (rule blocks, action types, tool boundaries) maps poorly to Cedar's structure.
- Cedar policies are written in a bespoke syntax, not YAML. Adopting Cedar would require either a YAML-to-Cedar transpiler (complexity) or abandoning YAML (breaking change).
- Cedar's formal verification is powerful but adds significant implementation complexity to every SDK. HushSpec targets minimal footprint across four languages.
- Cedar is Apache-licensed and open-source, but its ecosystem is AWS-centric. HushSpec is cloud-agnostic.

**What we took from Cedar:** Cedar's approach to deny-overrides-allow influenced HushSpec's decision precedence (Section 6.1). Cedar's condition expressions (`when { ... }`) inspired our `when` field name and positioning.

### 9.3 Casbin

Casbin is a multi-language authorization library supporting RBAC, ABAC, ACL, and custom models via a PERM (Policy, Effect, Request, Matchers) metamodel.

**Why not:**
- Casbin's matcher expressions are string-based DSL snippets (e.g., `r.sub == p.sub && r.obj == p.obj`). While more expressive than HushSpec conditions, they introduce a micro-language that is difficult to validate statically and audit without understanding Casbin's evaluation semantics.
- Casbin's model file + policy file split adds conceptual overhead. HushSpec aims for single-document policies that are self-contained and understandable in isolation.
- Casbin's ABAC support is powerful but general-purpose. HushSpec's condition types are intentionally domain-specific (time windows, agent capabilities, action rates) to provide better defaults and clearer semantics for the AI agent security domain.
- Casbin does not have a fail-closed default. Policies that do not match any rule produce engine-specific behavior, which conflicts with HushSpec's deny-by-default principle.

**What we took from Casbin:** Casbin's multi-language approach (Go, Java, Node.js, Python, Rust, etc.) validated HushSpec's strategy of providing SDKs in multiple languages with shared conformance tests. Casbin's ABAC model influenced the structure of our context object.

### 9.4 Raw Code Policies (JavaScript/Python/Lua)

Embedding policy logic as executable code was considered for maximum flexibility.

**Why not:**
- Executable policies are not auditable without reading and understanding the code. A YAML condition like `context: { environment: production }` is immediately comprehensible; a JavaScript function `(ctx) => ctx.environment === "production"` requires trusting the code is correct.
- Code policies are not portable. A JavaScript policy cannot run in a Rust or Go engine without embedding a JS runtime.
- Code policies can have side effects, access the network, modify state, or loop infinitely. None of these are acceptable for a security policy language.
- Code policies cannot be statically analyzed for coverage, conflicts, or completeness.

**What we took from code policies:** The recognition that some organizations genuinely need custom logic beyond what a fixed condition system provides. This is addressed by the `custom` namespace in the context object, which allows engines to inject arbitrary runtime data that conditions can match against using the standard `context` condition type.

### 9.5 Policy as Configuration Only (No Conditions)

The simplest alternative: keep HushSpec purely static and rely on external tooling (Terraform, Ansible, CI/CD pipelines) to swap policy documents based on context.

**Why not:**
- This approach works for environment-based variation (deploy different policies to production vs. staging) but fails for temporal variation (business hours), user-based variation (different rules for different roles), and rate-based variation (degrade after heavy usage).
- External policy swapping is not auditable within HushSpec itself -- an auditor examining a policy document has no way to know that a different document is used in production.
- It fragments the policy across multiple systems, making it harder to understand the complete security posture.

**What we took from this approach:** The recognition that many use cases are adequately served by static policies with external orchestration. Conditions are optional precisely because this simpler approach is often sufficient. The policy library includes static policies (using `hushspec: "0.1.0"`) alongside conditional ones (using `hushspec: "0.2.0"`).

## Appendix A: Full Condition Type Reference

| Condition Type | Activation Semantics | Fail-Closed Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `time_window` | True when current wall-clock time falls within the specified window | Invalid timezone or time format: document rejection |
| `context` | True when all specified context paths match their expected values | Missing context field: evaluates to false |
| `capability` | True when agent capabilities satisfy `has`/`lacks` constraints | Missing `agent.capabilities`: evaluates to false |
| `rate` | True when action count is above/below threshold in sliding window | Engine lacks rate tracking: evaluates to false |
| `all_of` | True when all child conditions are true | Any child error: propagates per child type |
| `any_of` | True when at least one child condition is true | All children error: evaluates to false |
| `not` | True when child condition is false | Child error: propagates per child type |

    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Note on `additionalProperties`:** The top-level context object uses `additionalProperties: false` to ensure condition authors do not reference undefined standard paths. Engine-specific data MUST be placed under the `custom` namespace, which permits arbitrary subfields. This design ensures that condition paths like `custom.my_engine.feature_flag` work correctly while typos in standard paths (e.g., `usr.role` instead of `user.role`) are caught by schema validation.
